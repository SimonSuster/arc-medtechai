## Context-specific Clinical Decision Support Leveraging Clinical Practice Guidelines
     
This PhD project will focus on identification of relevant clinical guidelines
for a given clinical situation. In particular, the emphasis of the project
will be to explore methods from information retrieval and natural language
processing to identify key clinical practice guidelines to guide clinical
decision making. It will require some modelling of the typical clinical
decision-making process and understanding of key decision points in clinical
care, in order to align clinical situations to particular steps or stages in a
clinical guideline. It will explore the required depth of analysis of
guidelines relative to the clinical situation â€“ is it sufficient to retrieve a
complete guideline, or do specific paragraphs or sentences need to be
identified? How important is presentation of the background evidence in the
published literature to support the clinical decision?

If suitable clinical data sets can be identified, the project will also
consider how to use clinical data from medical consultations to trigger
identification of a relevant clinical guideline at a relevant moment in a
patient interaction, to support clinical decision making.

#### Candidate background:

The suitable candidate will have a MSc degree in Computer Science, Computational Linguistics,
Artificial Intelligence, or related fields, with good coursework results, evidence of strong capacity
for research, and good English skills.

#### Description of the project environment:

The project is embedded within the Centre, where up to 14 PhD students, 5
post-doctoral researchers, and 11 University of Melbourne staff will
collaborate across 4 research streams with researchers at IBM Research and a
number of other Australian Universities, including RMIT University, the
University of South Australia, and Western Sydney University. The student for
this project will be jointly supervised between the University of Melbourne,
RMIT University, and IBM Research and will have the opportunity to spend 12
months of their candidature working on site at an IBM Research laboratory.

This project will also benefit from the context of the Natural Language Processing group at the
University of Melbourne, including Professor Tim Baldwin, Professor Karin Verspoor, and
Associate Professor Trevor Cohn, and their existing students and research fellows. Professor
Baldwin is the Director of the training centre, while Professor Verspoor is the Deputy Director and
Lead of the Natural Language Processing Stream in the centre.

#### Key areas involved in the research:

* natural language processing
* information retrieval
* health informatics


## Seizure Forecasting using Neural Networks
     
This project aims to improve performance of seizure forecasting.  The outcome will be a system that provides estimates of the likelihood that a person will or will not have a seizure during a relevant forecasting time horizon. Artificial neural networks have demonstrated superior performance in seizure forecasting. This project will build upon our earlier work to develop new approaches based on convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and other approaches. There is potential to incorporate other sources of relevant data, such as time of day and movement tracking, as well as EEG.
