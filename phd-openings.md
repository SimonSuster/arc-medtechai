* [PhD Openings - Expressions of Interest](https://goo.gl/forms/C3wBKWtw5Igaumat1)



### Description of the project environment:

These project are embedded within the Centre, where up to 14 PhD students, 5 post-doctoral researchers, and 11 University of Melbourne staff will collaborate across 4 research streams with researchers at IBM Research and a number of other Australian Universities, including RMIT University, the University of South Australia, and Western Sydney University. Each student will be jointly supervised by Universities and IBM Research and will spend at least 12 months of their candidature working on site at an IBM Research laboratory.



## Context-specific Clinical Decision Support Leveraging Clinical Practice Guidelines
     
This PhD project will focus on identification of relevant clinical guidelines
for a given clinical situation. In particular, the emphasis of the project
will be to explore methods from information retrieval and natural language
processing to identify key clinical practice guidelines to guide clinical
decision making. It will require some modelling of the typical clinical
decision-making process and understanding of key decision points in clinical
care, in order to align clinical situations to particular steps or stages in a
clinical guideline. It will explore the required depth of analysis of
guidelines relative to the clinical situation – is it sufficient to retrieve a
complete guideline, or do specific paragraphs or sentences need to be
identified? How important is presentation of the background evidence in the
published literature to support the clinical decision?

If suitable clinical data sets can be identified, the project will also
consider how to use clinical data from medical consultations to trigger
identification of a relevant clinical guideline at a relevant moment in a
patient interaction, to support clinical decision making.

The suitable candidate will have a MSc degree in Computer Science, Computational Linguistics,
Artificial Intelligence, or related fields, with good coursework results, evidence of strong capacity
for research, and good English skills.

This project will be based at RMIT University, working directly with Associate Professor Lawrence Cavedon and will also benefit from the context of the Natural Language Processing group at the University of Melbourne, including Professor Tim Baldwin, Professor Karin Verspoor, and Associate Professor Trevor Cohn, and their existing students and research fellows. Professor Baldwin is the Director of the training centre, while Professor Verspoor is the Deputy Director and Lead of the Natural Language Processing Stream in the centre.

*Key areas involved in the research:* natural language processing, information retrieval, health informatics


## Multi-document summarisation supporting clinical evidence review
     
This project will focus on summarisation of the background literature relevant to a given clinical question. Under the assumption that a relevant body of literature for a clinical question can be identified, the objective will be abstractive summarisation of that literature with sensitivity to the clinical question that is being explored. 

The student project work will focus on natural language generation for the summaries, and consider adaptation of the summaries for different audiences based on readability, background knowledge, desired summary length, etc. to cater to different requirements.

## Seizure Forecasting using Neural Networks
     
This project aims to improve performance of epileptic seizure forecasting. The outcome will be a system that provides estimates of the likelihood that a person will or will not have a seizure during a relevant forecasting time horizon. Artificial neural networks have demonstrated superior performance in seizure forecasting. This project will build upon our earlier work to develop new approaches based on convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and other approaches. There is potential to incorporate other sources of relevant data, such as time of day and movement tracking, as well as EEG.

The suitable candidate will have an Honours or Masters degree in Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, Computer Science, or related fields, with good coursework results, evidence of strong capacity for research, and good English skills.

*Key areas involved in the research:* signal processing, machine learning, neural networks


## Deep Learning for Fitting Neural Mass Models to EEG
     
This project aims to improve performance of seizure prediction by linking neural mass models to deep learning techniques. Neural mass models have been able to model and reproduce output signals that replicate different types of intracranial EEG recordings. Data assimilation with Kalman filters has been successful in investigating how variations in model parameters can lead to the different behaviours. However, to use these models for seizure prediction, high fidelity models are needed that incorporate mechanisms of parameter variation that are intrinsic to the model. This project will develop augmented neural mass models and deep learning and other machine learning techniques to fit the models to patient-specific iEEG recordings.

The suitable candidate will have an Honours or Masters degree in Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, Computer Science, or related fields, with good coursework results, evidence of strong capacity for research, and good English skills.

*Key areas involved in the research:* advanced signal processing, machine learning, neural modelling


## Brain-Computer Interfaces for low-powered mobile/wearable devices
     
This project aims to develop a brain-computer interface system with emphasis on low power consumption and small memory requirements, without compromising on accuracy. The outcome of this project will be novel CNN models that incorporate spatiotemporal information, produce fast inference, and achieve small memory foot-prints so that they can be deployed in wearable devices or mobile computing platforms. The greatest challenge will be to maintain the required accuracy and performance while reducing the model size and the overall latency of the system.

The suitable candidate will have an Honours or Masters degree in Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, Computer Science, or related fields, with good coursework results, evidence of strong capacity for research, and good English skills.

*Key areas involved in the research:* signal processing, machine learning, neural networks, embedded systems


## Multimodal Brain-Computer Interfaces for augmented reality and virtual reality applications
     
This project aims to develop a brain-computer interface system that allows people with speech, vision or motor disorders to interact in an augmented/virtual environment (e.g., selecting/manipulating an object of interest, walking/exploring a remote site). This AR/VR-based BCI will allow users to learn and adapt to the BCI in a more swift manner with countless possibilities of application scenarios, compared to the conventional case of a task-specific BCI (e.g., to control a robotic arm). Furthermore, AR/VR-based BCI systems will be safer to operate, can be deployed anywhere with minimal hardware constraints, and will provide an extremely efficient training platform to decode the brain’s intent. Brain-computer interfaces rely upon good recordings of neural signals, typically with scalp or intracranial EEG systems. This project will build a multimodal BCI system that augments the EEG signals through speech recognition and gaze tracking as a multimodal input to the system to further enhance the performance/accuracy of the system for the desired application scenarios.

The suitable candidate will have an Honours or Masters degree in Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, Computer Science, or related fields, with good coursework results, evidence of strong capacity for research, and good English skills.
