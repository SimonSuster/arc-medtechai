Congratulations to Professor David Grayden, Professor Tony Burkitt, Professor Mark Cook and their team at The University of Melbourne on being awarded an NHMRC Development Grant of $934,902 for their Stentrode Neuro-stimulator project. Epilepsy affects over 65 million people worldwide and approximately 30% of sufferers do not respond to drugs. For these people, electrodes are placed in the brain to monitor brain activity and stop the initiation or progression of seizures. However, state-of-the-art devices require risky open-brain surgery. In this project, David and his team are developing a Stentrode Neuro-Stimulator (SNS) for the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy without the need for open-brain surgery.
