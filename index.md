The ARC Training Centre in Cognitive Computing for Medical Technologies is
aimed at creating a workforce that is expert in developing, applying and
interrogating artificial intelligence ("AI") applications in data-intensive medical
contexts, to facilitate the next generation of data-driven and machine
learning-based medical technologies. The Centre will provide a world-class
industry-driven research training environment for PhD students and
postdoctoral researchers, who will lead the medical technology industry into a
new era of data-driven personalised and precision medical devices and
applications, based on a combination of research, industry and entrepreneurial
skills they will acquire through the Centre.

In close partnership with IBM Research-Australia &mdash; global leaders in machine
learning, artificial intelligence, natural language processing (NLP) and
biomedical engineering &mdash; the Centre is hosted at The University of
Melbourne, in collaboration with Western Sydney University, RMIT University,
and the University of South Australia. Domain and industry expertise is
provided by medical device manufacturer Medtronic, St Vincentâ€™s Hospital, the
Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, Melbourne Academic Centre
for Health (MACH), and Cogstate.

Funding for the Centre is in the form of $4.1m from the Australian Research
Council under the Industrial Transformation Research Program, and $3.5m of
cash and in-kind support from IBM Research-Australia. This will fund 15 PhD
students and 5 full-time post-doc researchers over the 5 year duration of the
Centre. Students will be co-supervised by university-based academics and IBM
Research-Australia researchers, and be physically hosted within the unique
facilities of IBM Research for part of their candidature.
