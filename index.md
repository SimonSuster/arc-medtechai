The ARC Training Centre in Cognitive Computing for Medical Technologies is
aimed at creating a workforce that is expert in developing, applying and
interrogating artificial intelligence ("AI") applications in data-intensive medical
contexts, to facilitate the next generation of data-driven and machine
learning-based medical technologies. The Centre will provide a world-class
industry-driven research training environment for PhD students and
postdoctoral researchers, who will lead the medical technology industry into a
new era of data-driven personalised and precision medical devices and
applications, based on a combination of research, industry and entrepreneurial
skills they will acquire through the Centre.
