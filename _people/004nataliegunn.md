Natalie is a Research Scientist at IBM Research - Australia. Her expertise is in the field of structural biology. She completed her PhD in 2012 at the University of Melbourne. Her current research interests are investigating the structure and function of important protein drug targets called G protein-coupled receptors. She is using facilities at the Australian Synchrotron and works in close collaboration with researchers from the Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health to generate a better understanding of how G protein-coupled receptors function and this information can be used in the development of novel therapeutic agents that target these receptors.
