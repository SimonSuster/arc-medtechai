title:  "Neuro-inspired Machine Learning Approaches to
Predicting/Modelling Epilepsy, and Machine Learning for Controlling
Brain-Computer Interfaces"
subtitle: "Stream 2"
---
This project aims to bring together neural models of the brain with machine learning to study and treat epilepsy. This project will develop patient-specific neural field models and neural mass models that replicate recorded EEG signals with high fidelity. The underlying model states and parameters will be used as inputs to machine learning algorithms to predict seizures and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of epilepsy. This combined approach will help us to understand the causes and behaviours of epileptic seizures and build high fidelity models for epileptic seizure prediction.



This project aims to develop a control system that is computationally efficient (i.e., fast response time) and achieves high task-specific performance for a brain-computer interface (BCI). The project also aims to develop a neural network-based BCI that can be used to control commercially available augmentative devices for individuals with speech, vision, or motor disorders (to interact in AR/VR environments using only their brain activity). In this context, non-EEG data sources, such as speech recognition and gaze tracking will be investigated and incorporated where possible to develop training systems for both the brain-computer interfaces system and the user.

content="<p>Professor David Grayden is Head of the Department of Biomedical Engineering, Melbourne School of Engineering and Leader of the Bionics Laboratory in the Centre for Neural Engineering, The University of Melbourne.</p>
<p>Prof Grayden&#39;s main research interests are in understanding how the brain processes information, how best to present information to the brain using medical bionics, such as the bionic ear and bionic eye, and how to record information from the brain, such as for brain-machine interfaces. He is also conducting research in epileptic seizure prediction and electrical stimulation to prevent or stop epileptic seizures, and in electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve to control inflammatory bowel disease. He has research linkages with the Bionics Institute, St Vincent&#39;s Hospital Melbourne, Royal Melbourne Hospital, University of South Australia, Florey Institute for Neuroscience and Mental Health, and University of Maryland, USA.</p>"

name="Dr Dean Freestone"
role="Senior Research Fellow"
company="St Vincent’s Hospital, The University of Melbourne"
content="<p>Dr Freestone’s research is focused on reverse engineering the human brain. He is developing methods to create a mathematical blueprint of the brain, so engineering methods can be used to treat neurological disorders. His research findings are about to be trialled in a brain implant designed to predict and control epileptic seizures in collaboration with the medical device company Medtronic. He also works closely IBM Australia, where the team is creating specialised computer chips that can interface with the brain and bypass broken neural circuits.</p>
<p>Dr Freestone has a degree in Electronic Engineering from La Trobe University, where he won the Vice-Chancellor's Travelling Scholarship, the Tad Szental Prize for the best engineering final year student and the Hooper Memorial Prize for best final year project. In 2012, Dr Freestone completed his PhD in the Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department at the University of Melbourne (and The University of Edinburgh on exchange), where he won the John Melvin Memorial Scholarship for the best PhD in Engineering and the University wide Chancellor’s Prize for PhD Excellence. Dr Freestone was the 2014-2015 Victorian Fulbright Postdoctoral Fellow, where he worked in the Neural Statistics Lab at Columbia University in New York City, USA. He is now a junior faculty member in the Department of Medicine at St. Vincent’s Hospital Melbourne, since October 2015.</p>"
