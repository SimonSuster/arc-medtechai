name="Professor David Grayden"
role="Head of Biomedical Engineering"

content="<p>Professor David Grayden is Head of the Department of Biomedical Engineering, Melbourne School of Engineering and Leader of the Bionics Laboratory in the Centre for Neural Engineering, The University of Melbourne.</p>
<p>Prof Grayden&#39;s main research interests are in understanding how the brain processes information, how best to present information to the brain using medical bionics, such as the bionic ear and bionic eye, and how to record information from the brain, such as for brain-machine interfaces. He is also conducting research in epileptic seizure prediction and electrical stimulation to prevent or stop epileptic seizures, and in electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve to control inflammatory bowel disease. He has research linkages with the Bionics Institute, St Vincent&#39;s Hospital Melbourne, Royal Melbourne Hospital, University of South Australia, Florey Institute for Neuroscience and Mental Health, and University of Maryland, USA.</p>"

name="Dr Dean Freestone"
role="Senior Research Fellow"
company="St Vincent’s Hospital, The University of Melbourne"
content="<p>Dr Freestone’s research is focused on reverse engineering the human brain. He is developing methods to create a mathematical blueprint of the brain, so engineering methods can be used to treat neurological disorders. His research findings are about to be trialled in a brain implant designed to predict and control epileptic seizures in collaboration with the medical device company Medtronic. He also works closely IBM Australia, where the team is creating specialised computer chips that can interface with the brain and bypass broken neural circuits.</p>
<p>Dr Freestone has a degree in Electronic Engineering from La Trobe University, where he won the Vice-Chancellor's Travelling Scholarship, the Tad Szental Prize for the best engineering final year student and the Hooper Memorial Prize for best final year project. In 2012, Dr Freestone completed his PhD in the Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department at the University of Melbourne (and The University of Edinburgh on exchange), where he won the John Melvin Memorial Scholarship for the best PhD in Engineering and the University wide Chancellor’s Prize for PhD Excellence. Dr Freestone was the 2014-2015 Victorian Fulbright Postdoctoral Fellow, where he worked in the Neural Statistics Lab at Columbia University in New York City, USA. He is now a junior faculty member in the Department of Medicine at St. Vincent’s Hospital Melbourne, since October 2015.</p>"

role="Research Scientist"
company="IBM Research – Australia"
content="I am working on projects around image analytics with applications to healthcare and Neurobionics using deep learning and 3D computer vision. I design and build novel deep Convolutional Neural Network models using state of the art deep learning frameworks like PYTORCH, CAFFE and KERAS, for low-power mobile supercomputer devices like Nvidia Jetson for a variety of tasks such as medical image analytics, robotic grasping, and 3D scene understanding."
