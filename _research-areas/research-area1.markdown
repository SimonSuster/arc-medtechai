title:  "Model Development and Low-power Deployment of Machine Learning for Epileptic Seizure Prediction"
subtitle: "Stream 1"
---
This project aims to develop and apply state-of-the-art machine learning approaches for epileptic seizure prediction and assessing the efficacy of epilepsy medication.  It will develop two types of new machine learning models: (i) Type I models will be designed to analyse multimodal time-series data for epileptic seizure prediction with a special focus on recurrent neural network models and EEG, time of day, and movement tracking data; (ii) Type II models will be designed to analyse medical patient records for assessing and improving the efficacy of epilepsy medication, by investigating correlations between administered medication and evidence on patient outcomes.

content="<p>Professor David Grayden is the Clifford Chair of Neural Engineering in the Department of Biomedical Engineering, and Leader of the Bionics Laboratory in the Centre for Neural Engineering, Melbourne School of Engineering, The University of Melbourne.</p>
<p>Prof Grayden&#39;s main research interests are in understanding how the brain processes information, how best to present information to the brain using medical bionics, such as the bionic ear and bionic eye, and how to record information from the brain, such as for brain-machine interfaces. He is also conducting research in epileptic seizure prediction and electrical stimulation to prevent or stop epileptic seizures, and in electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve to control inflammatory bowel disease. He has research linkages with the Bionics Institute, St Vincent&#39;s Hospital Melbourne, Royal Melbourne Hospital, University of South Australia, Florey Institute for Neuroscience and Mental Health, and University of Maryland, USA.</p>"

content="<p>Dr Jordan Chambers joined the Epileptic seizure prediction stream of the ARC Training Centre as a Research Fellow in May 2019. His research has focused on understanding the behaviour of neural networks by combining mathematical and computational modelling with electrophysiological data.</p><p>
  
Dr Jordan Chambers was awarded his PhD from the Department of Physiology, University of Melbourne in 2012. Since then, he has held post-doctoral positions at The Howard Florey Institute and the University of Melbourne. At The Howard Florey Institute, he investigated the effect synaptic strengths have on the behaviour of a cortical column to produce epileptic seizures. In the Department of Physiology, University of Melbourne, he developed a detailed conductance based single neuron model of sensory neurons in the small intestine to predict hyper-excitable states associated with inflammation of the intestine. As a research fellow in the Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Melbourne, he developed a model of the auditory system to investigate mechanisms utilised by the auditory cortex to process sound signals in a noisy environment.</p>"

content="<p>Professor Anthony (Tony) Burkitt holds the Chair in Bio-Signals and Bio-Systems in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Melbourne since 2007. His research encompasses a number of areas of neural engineering, including medical bionics, computational neuroscience, retinal-implant vision processing, cochlear-implant speech processing and bio-signal processing for epilepsy. His research has made significant contributions to understanding the behaviour and function of neural information processing in the brain and it has also been instrumental in the development of visual stimulation paradigms for retinal implants, new cochlear implant speech processing strategies, methods for detecting and predicting seizures, and the use of electrical stimulation for seizure abatement in epilepsy. He was the Director of Bionic Vision Australia (2010-2016), a Special Research Initiative in Bionic Vision Science and Technology of the Australian Research Council (ARC), and he successfully led the project though all of its phases: Project conception, securing $50million in ARC funding, the research and development programs that led to the development of a prototype bionic eye (suprachoroidal retinal implant), the successful implantation in three patients, and the establishment of the company Bionic Vision Technologies (BVT) with US$18million of venture capital for the ongoing commercial and clinical development of the technology.</p>"
