title:  "Real-time clinical decision support"
subtitle: "Stream 4"
---
Medical knowledge is increasing exponentially, and it is the job of the clinician to continually stay abreast of the latest medical findings. Clinicians make use of the most recent diagnostic tools and use these to optimise a treatment plan based on the best medical knowledge available. However, it is unrealistic to expect a clinician to have perfect knowledge of all medical literature. A better approach is to develop NLP solutions that are able to automatically extract clinical guidelines from medical literature, and identify the recommended approaches to preventing or treating a given disease in a specific clinical situation. In this project the key focuses include: (1) abstractive summarisation of medical literature (single- and multi-document, and document- and subdocument-level), based on deep learning; (2) inferring new relations for entities, based on using deep learning to project textual relations and entities into a dense latent representation, extending work that has been done on more general knowledge base population tasks; and (3) hybrid text and image analytics over medical textbooks and full-text articles, integrating text and explanatory figures using deep learning and adversarial training methods.

role="Associate Dean for Computer Science and IT"
company="RMIT University"
content="<p>Professor Lawrence Cavedon is Associate Dean for Computer Science and IT in the School of Science at RMIT University. His research focuses strongly on industry collaboration and impact.  From July 2005 until March 2014 Lawrence was also a Senior Researcher at the NICTA Victoria Research Lab, where he led the BioTALA (Biomedical Text and Language Applications) project, which developed text analytics techniques for biomedical applications, mainly in collaboration with hospital partners, including Alfred Health, Melbourne Health, the Peter Macallum Cancer Research Centre, and Barwon Health.</p>
<p>Prior to joining NICTA, Lawrence spent 3 years as a Senior Researcher at Stanford University, in the Center for the Study of Language and Information. During that time he worked on developing practical speech-based dialogue systems, and collaborated with organizations such as Boeing, NASA, Bosch, and VW America, resulting in US and international patents and commercially-licensed software patents. Prior to that, he worked in the Advanced Technology Group at VerticalNet Inc., a silicon valley company that developed new technologies for the large-enterprise space.</p>
Lawrence holds a PhD (1995) from the University of Edinburgh, and B.Sc. (Hons) (1986) and M.Sc. (1989) degrees from the University of Melbourne.</p>"%}

role="Lecturer"
company="The University of Melbourne"
content="<p>Jey Han's research is in the intersection of machine learning and language, and his vision is to explore machine learning models to better understand language. He has a particular interest in language generation — tasks that require machine learning models to produce language, e.g. summarisation and story generation — and unsupervised learning — learning where supervision signal is not available. Prior to joining the University of Melbourne, Jey Han spent over 3.5 years as an industry scientist at IBM Research, developing solutions for clients in application domains from education to government. Parallel to this, he was active in research and collaborated with universities around the world, and in recognition of his scientific achievements he was awarded a research accomplishment prize by IBM in 2019.</p>"
